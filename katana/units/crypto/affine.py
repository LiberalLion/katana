"""

Attempt to decrypt a target with the classic Affine cipher.

You can read more about the Affine cipher here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher

This unit inherits from the 
:class:`katana.unit.NotEnglishAndPrintableUnit` class, as we can expect
the data to still be printable characters (letters, numbers and punctuation)
but not readable English.

You can supply and customize the given A and B values as well as the
alphabet to be used in the Affine cipher operation, though by default
this will bruteforce and use the range provided with the English alphabet,
letters A-Z.
