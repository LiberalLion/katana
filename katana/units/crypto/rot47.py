ROT47 decoder

The gist of this code is ripped from 
https://rot47.net/_py/rot47.txt. 

This unit inherits from the 
:class:`katana.unit.NotEnglishAndPrintableUnit` class, as we can expect
the data to still be printable characters (letters, numbers and punctuation)
but not readable English. It also inherits from the 
:class:`katana.units.crypto.CryptoUnit` class to ensure it is not a viable
URL or potentially useful file.
