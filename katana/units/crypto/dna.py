DNA/Codon Cipher.

This unit will translate groupings of letters (A,T,C,G,U) into 
22 out of 26 possible English characters.

This unit inherits from the 
:class:`katana.unit.NotEnglishAndPrintableUnit` class, as we can expect
the data to still be printable characters (letters, numbers and punctuation)
but not readable English. It also inherits from the 
:class:`katana.units.crypto.CryptoUnit` class to ensure it is not a viable
URL or potentially useful file.
