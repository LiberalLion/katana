"""

Attempt to crack an MD5 hash.

This unit finds potential MD5 hashes matching the defined regular expression:

.. code-block:: python

    MD5_PATTERN = re.compile(rb"[a-fA-F0-9]{32}", re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)

This unit cracks the MD5 hash by using a supplied password or dictionary
file. Currently it does not support reaching out to an online cracker,
though this would be ideal.
