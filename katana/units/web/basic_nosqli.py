Basic NoSQL Injection 

This will attempt basic NoSQL injection (MongoDB) of the form 
``"username": {"$gt": ""}, "password": {"$gt": ""},``.

It passes a User-Agent to act as a regular Firefox web browser.

This unit inherits from :class:`katana.units.web.WebUnit` as that contains
lots of predefined variables that can be used throughout multiple web units.

.. warning::
    
    This unit automatically attempts to perform malicious actions on the 
    target. **DO NOT** use this in any circumstances where you do not have the
    authority to operate!
