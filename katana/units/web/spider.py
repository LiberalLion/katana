Spider web pages

This unit will look through all of the different links on a website and
queue each of them as a new target, or link to explore.

This unit inherits from :class:`katana.units.web.WebUnit` as that contains
lots of predefined variables that can be used throughout multiple web units.

.. warning::
    
    This unit automatically attempts to perform malicious actions on the 
    target. **DO NOT** use this in any circumstances where you do not have the
    authority to operate!
