"""
Extract hidden data with ``steghide``

This unit will extract hidden data file using the ``steghide``
command-line utility. First the unit will try with an empty
password, and then it will try with the user-supplied password argument. 
Finally, it will bruteforce with a upplied dictionary file. 
The syntax runs as::

    steghide extract -sf <target_path> -p <password> -xf <steghide_directory>


The unit inherits from :class:`katana.unit.FileUnit` to ensure the target
is a JPG file.

.. note::
    
    ``steghide`` only works on JPG files!
