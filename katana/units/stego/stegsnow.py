"""
Extract hidden data with ``stegsnow``

This unit will extract hidden data file using the ``steghide``
command-line utility. First the unit will try with an empty
password, and then it will try with the user-supplied password argument. 
Finally, it will bruteforce with a upplied dictionary file. 
The syntax runs as::

    stegsnow -C -p  <password> <target_path>


The unit inherits from :class:`katana.unit.FileUnit` to ensure the target
is a file.
