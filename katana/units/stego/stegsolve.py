"""
Reveal color planes on an image with ``stegsolve``.

This unit is a Python implementation of ``stegsolve.jar``, which is often
used for CTF challenges.

You can supply a ``channel`` or ``plane`` index to specifically extract, but
if these arguments are not given the unit will bruteforce and grab the least
4 bits of each color channel (R, G, B, typically).

The unit inherits from :class:`katana.unit.FileUnit` to ensure the target
is an image file.
