Extract hidden data with ``zsteg``

This unit will extract hidden data file using the ``zsteg``
command-line utility. The syntax runs as::

    zsteg <arguments> <target_path>

This unit will use only preselected arguments to search with ``zsteg``. 
This saves processing time, and still seems to find the majority of flags.

The unit inherits from :class:`katana.unit.FileUnit` to ensure the target
is a PNG file.

.. note::
    
    ``zsteg`` only works with PNG files!
