"""
Pikalang esoteric decoder

This unit will map the Pikalang operations to their Brainfuck equivalant,
and then pass along the actual execution to the Brainfuck unit's
``evaluate_brainfuck`` function.

In the previous framework of Katana, this unit attempted to decode
Pikalang in seemingly TWO different variations. One was a literal mapping
to Brainfuck code, the other did something different that required much more 
code (https://github.com/joelsmithjohnson/pikachu-interpreter)

I have not translated that other code to use bytes, and I do not see the need
to do so currently, considering how obscure Pikalang is to begin with.
